# README

Math-Is-A-Joke is a project designed with the goal of creating a fun, interactive, and educational product for students who wish to hone their math skills AND stay engaged.

This web app is quite simple. Random setups for jokes are given as prompts and the user will have to answer a randomly generated math problem (basic arithmetic) in a short amount of time in order to get the punchline of the joke. Users will be able to create their own jokes in the process, and contribute to the fun.
